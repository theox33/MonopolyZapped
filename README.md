# 🎲 Monopoly Zapped – Android App  

## 📖 What is it?  
This project is an **open-source Android adaptation** of the Monopoly Zapped board game, originally released only on iPad.  
It is a complete reimplementation designed to bring back the experience on modern Android smartphones and tablets.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal is to **recreate the original Monopoly Zapped experience** by:  
- Scanning player cards on the device screen  
- Automatically managing money and transactions  
- Including the mini-games from Chance and Community Chest cards  

## 🧩 Problem it solves  
The original app is no longer available or maintained, preventing owners of the physical Monopoly Zapped game from enjoying it.  
👉 This project provides a **maintainable, evolvable, and free alternative** for Android devices.  

## ⚙️ Features (in progress)  
- ✅ Player setup and card management  
- ✅ Card scanning for payments  
- ✅ Automatic money tracking  
- 🚧 Mini-games (Chance & Community Chest)  
- 🚧 Animations and UI close to the original iPad app  

## 🔮 Roadmap  
- Support for different screen resolutions and aspect ratios  
- Sound effects and music from the original game (if legally possible, otherwise re-created)  
- Local multiplayer support (and potentially online in the future)  
- Stable release on the Google Play Store
